Current/Emerging Trends in CS

In this project, we needed to build a program that allowed an AI to play a Treasure Hunt Game. The goal was to have the agent find the best possible route to find the treasure. To do this project, we were given a good majority of the application, such as the movements, neural network model, maze, rewards, penalties, game states, and much more. Then, our job was to create a Q-learning algorithm that trained the agent to win the game. The agent was able to win the game by having the algorithm store the previous runs information and updating the neural network with it. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists do a lot for this era, especially since our world relies so much on technology. Computer scientists are the reason our technology is continuously advancing. They work to find solutions to current system problems and invent new systems. Their work matters because the need for more advanced technologies is constantly growing.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I think the computer scientist approach is examining the problem to be solved. Next, I would think about the best way to solve the issue. Then, the next step would be to design and implement the solution to that problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end-user and the organization would be to create an ethical program. That means the program should not hold any intentional or unintentional bias. Also, the program should not get made or used to hurt or threaten anyone's wellbeing. If a user were to be affected by an unethical program, the organization would be greatly impacted as well.
